<p>Naturally, the bigger the house, the more paint you’ll need. It has more to do with the materials and equipment needed to do the job right as it has to do with the actual paint required. Typical interior house painting estimates for a 1500 square foot home averages between $2,000 to $3,500 and use around 10 gallons of paint with two coats of paint for painting the walls only. The rule of thumb is 250 to 400 square feet per gallon per coat depending on the porosity. See professionally prepared estimates for home interior painting work.
