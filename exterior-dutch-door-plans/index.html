<p>Doors separate one room from another and provide us with privacy. Adding a dutch door to the baby’s room adds some style and privacy to your living room too. (see more of our favorite barn door ideas here.) i do speak dutch, so having a dutch barn door door sounded like a genius plan to me! Choosing the right door hardware for your dutch door is vital. Dutch doors as entry doors also require additional security measures in comparison to their interior counterparts. Pin on Sugar Plum Sage.</p>
