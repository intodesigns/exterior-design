<p><strong>Alternate Exterior Angles Meaning</strong>, Alternate exterior angles are a pair of angles on the outer side of each of those two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal. Alternate exterior angles theorem the alternate exterior angles theorem states that, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal , the resulting alternate exterior angles are congruent. They are located “outside” the two parallel lines but on opposite sides of the transversal, creating two pairs (four total angles) of alternate exterior angles.</p>
