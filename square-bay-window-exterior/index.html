<p>We have recently been seeing rounded designs which are equally as interesting. A bay window is a combination of three or more windows which angle out beyond an exterior wall. All of the above refers to a window structure that protrudes out from a flat wall and creates an area within the room, be it a rounded bay, bow or oriel space, or a square box area. Square or rectangular bays these necessitate the three sides to be set at 90 degrees to each other in order to form the square shape. It allows more light and ventilation to the interior part of the house. Pinterest • The world’s catalog of ideas.</p>

<p>The sides of this form of window are set at a 90 degree angle with the front window. A bay window is a combination of three or more windows which angle out beyond an exterior wall. It adds beauty and style to the exterior part of the house and adds new space to the interior of the house. Bay window is a generic term for all protruding window constructions, regardless of whether they are curved or angular, or run over one or multiple storeys. Before choosing a bay window, measure the depth of the eave horizontally. Pin by sharon on Home Ideas Bay window exterior, House.</p>
