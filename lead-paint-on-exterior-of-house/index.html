<p>Builder and editorial adviser mike guertin replies: Old paint on the exterior of your home can be just as much a risk as old paint on the inside, if not more so. Other lead compounds used in house paints included lead monoxide (litharge), lead orthoplumbate (red lead primer), lead silicates (base for white topcoats); The solution is to get the latex off (i used a simple putty knife to remove mine), lightly sand the (likely) glossy oil paint, wash the trim (i use a product called soilax), apply a good primer (latex primer is okay for this), and then 2 layers of a good latex paint. Sanding is a common removal method that can be dangerous to utilize on your own. How Long Does Paint Last? The Expiration Date on Your Home.</p>

<p>I remember back in the 1970s we had part of the contract on a new office building with a wielded steel post and girder frame. Lead is added to paint to accelerate drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. Then seal off adjacent rooms by. When the paint peels and cracks, it makes lead paint chips and dust. Lead is a toxic substance, and exposure to it can affect our health with a number of symptoms: Painted Siding On House With Lead Paint SurePro Painting.</p>
