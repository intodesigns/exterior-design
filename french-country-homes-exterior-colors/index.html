<p>My style is french country but my husband has other ideas, so i am trying to blend our two styles together. But then i see yellow doors, pink doors, teal doors, bright blue doors, even bleached wood doors and more. Look through exterior home pictures in different colors and styles and when you find a french country exterior home design that inspires you, save it to an ideabook or contact the pro who made it happen to see what kind of design ideas they have for your home. The colors you use in your country french home are beautiful. For exterior design, french house exterior often match bold colors next to earthy tones.
